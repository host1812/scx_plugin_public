       Checks if the given path is in /dev/mapper.

       \return This method will return true if the given path is a device-mapper
               path; false otherwise.

       \note Depending on the Linux distribution, a device-mapper (dm) device
             may have two paths.  On all distributions that support device-mapper,
             each dm device will have a path under /dev/mapper.  All entries
             under /dev/mapper represent a dm device partition, with the exception
             of /dev/mapper/control, which is a reserved name for the actual
             device that enables device-mapper.

             Many Linux distributions will have a second entry for each dm device.
             The second entry is named /dev/dm-<minor> where <minor> is the
             minor device id for the particular dm device.

             This method does not check the second path.  This method only checks
             if the given device path is located in /dev/mapper.

               returns an empty string.

             for the same underlying device.  If the right map is found, both
