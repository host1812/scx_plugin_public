cimcli - command line WBEM Client 
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>SYNOPSIS </H2>

<B>cimcli [operation]  [object]  [options]  [extra-parameters]</B>

<I>...</I>

<P>
cimcli is available for all platforms that support the Pegasus CIM Server.
<P>
<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION </H2>

<P>
<B>cimcli</B>

is a command line test tool for executing CIM client operations. It implements
all of the DMTF CIM operations except for the modify and create class/instance operations and includes several
other operations that are useful in testing including getting all namespaces and enumerating all
instances in a namespace.
<P>
Each execution of cimcli invokes a CIM Operation with the corresponding command parameters equivalent
to the CIM Operations defined in the CIM Operations over HTTP specification.
<P>
In addition to the basic CIM Operations defined in the specification, this tool implements a number of
other specific operations that support testing and querying CIM servers including  a command to query
for namespaces and to get all instances in a namespace.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>1.</B>

<DD>
Enumerate namespaces (ns) - Returns a list of the namespaces available from the CIMOM.
<DT><B>2.</B>

<DD>
Enumerate all instance names (niall) - Returns a list of all instance names in the defined namespace.
<DT><B>2.</B>

<DD>
Turn CIMServer statistics on and off (At least for the OpenPegasus server
<P>
The format of this command is generally:
<DT><B>cimcli [Operation] [objectname] [options] [extra parameters]</B>

<DD>
<P>
<DT><B>[Operation] </B>

<DD>
defines the  operation to be executed. cimcli executes all of the DMTF CIM Operations (ex. getclass)
and a set of compound operation (enumeratenamespaces). There
are two forms for each Operation definition, a short form typically two characters (i.e. gc)
and the long form which is the full name of the operation (i.e. getclass).
<DT><B>[objectname]</B>

<DD>
The name of the object input with the command. This parameter is operation dependent.
For example, with the getClass operation the object is a class name.
With the getinstance command the object is an object name. Note
that some of the commands do not require an object.   Thus, for example, the [object] is optional with
the enumerateClasses operation as it is with the equivalent  enumerateClassNames CIM operation. Normally
this is either a classname or an instancename (classname plus keybindings). In some operations one or the 
other is required.  In other operations, the behavior of the operation is dependent on whether classname
or instancename is supplied.
<DT><B>[options...] </B>

<DD>
Options are identified on the command line with the - or -- notation.  There are three types of options:
<P>
<DT><B>1.</B>

<DD>
A set of options that are universal and modify or define the execution of the command or the 
form of the return.  This includes options like setting the output format for object responses or
requesting only summary operation.
<DT><B>2.</B>

<DD>
A set of options that represent the optional input parameters for selected operation. The
command defines the CIM Operation that will be executed and the options define the optional characteristics.
Typical context options might be -n namespace (used on most but not all operations)or -niq which
sets includequalifiers to false for operations that use the includeQualifiers optional parameter.
<DT><B>3</B>

<DD>
A set of options to display help (-h, --help, --ho to get a list of all options, and
-hc to get a list of all commands. When these options are requested, no operation is
executed.
<DT><B>[extra-parameters]</B>

<DD>
Some of the operations allow or require extra parameters. these are typically keywords or keyword/value pairs
and are defined as part of the particular options that might use them.
<P>
Any extra parameters entities on the command line that occur after the [Operation] and are not preceeded by
&quot;-&quot; to indicate an option are considered extra paramters.  These are used in some of the operations to provide
additional information required or optionally desired by the operation.  See each operation definition to determine
if extra parameters are required or allowed.  These may be either keyname-value pairs in some cases or simply strings
depending on the operation.
<P>
<P>
NOTE: cimcli does not protect the user against inputting extra options or parameters.  Since the options are
heavily dependent on the operation to be executed, it simply ignores those options that are not used with a particular
operation.  Thus, entering the -r option (role) with a getClass operation is syntatically allowed but cimcli ignores
the parameter.
<P>
</DL>
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>UNIVERSAL OPTIONS</H2>

<P>
There is a set of options which are general to all of the CIM Operations and most of the 
compound operations and which provide parameters for the initiation or execution of the command. 
These include:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-n [namespace]</B>

<DD>
Namespace name for this operation (ex. -n root). The default namespace is root/cimv2.
<DT><B>-l [location]</B>

<DD>
Host name or IP address and optionally port for this operation. The default for this command
if the the -n option is not used is to use the Pegasus connectLocal() function to connect to the server.
Note that this means that a command like cimcli gc CIM_Door may not work when trying to connect to a 
server other than Pegasus on the same system. If cimcli is to be used to connect to a CIM Server other
than Pegasus on the same system use -l localhost or -l 127.0.0.1 or the actual name or IP address.
This will force cimcli to make the connection in the normal way, not using connectLocal()
<DT><B>-u [user-name]</B>

<DD>
The user name to be used in in the connection to the CIM server for the command
<DT><B>-p [password]</B>

<DD>
The password to be used in the connection to the CIM server for the command
<P>
In addition there is a set of options that modifies the manner in which the command is executed or
the display of information on response including the following:
<P>
<DT><B>--t</B>

<DD>
Measure time for the operation to be completed and report it upon command completion. If this option
is set, the time for the operation is recorded upon completion of the operation.  In addition, the 
client infrastructure is qeieried to determine if the operation execution times optionally measured
in the infrastructure and at the server are available. If they are, they are displayed also.  This
would allow the user to see a) time spent in the server, b) round trip time for the operation, c)
application round trip time for the operation. Note that when combined with the repeat option,
the output includes maximum, minimum, and average times for the operation.  There are a specific operations
in cimcli to turn control statistics generation (See son and soff operations)
<DT><B>--r [repeat_count]</B>

<DD>
Repeat the operation repeat_count times. This repeats the operation without disconnecting. This option is
useful for setting up tests that load the server with repeated calls and also for getting average times for
an operation by taking the average of a number of calls ( when used with the summary information option and
the measure time option). 
<DT><B>-delay [seconds]</B>

<DD>
Delay count seconds between connect and operation.
<DT><B>--sum</B>

<DD>
Present only summary information, not full output.  Generally it presents counts of objects returned and 
response times in place of the names or objects themselves.
<DT><B>--count [object_count]</B>

<DD>
Defines an expected count of objects expected on the response.  An error exit is generated if this
number of objects is not received.  This test can be used in batch files to test for number of objects
returned by an operation. 
<DT><B>--timeout [seconds]</B>

<DD>
Set the connect timeout to some time other than the default timeout.
<DT><B>-o [ xml | mof ]</B>

<DD>
Output type for commands that output objects. Used with commands that present CIM objects in
their response.
<DT><B>-verbose</B>

<DD>
Displays details on the options for the CIM Operation and execution.
<DT><DD>

<H2>OPERATIONS</H2>

This section defines the individual operations supported by cimcli. 
Note that the either the names (ex EnumerateInstances) or the shortcut (ei) may
be used in inputting an operation defintion and they they are case independent.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>ci    CreateInstance</B>

<DD>
NOTE: This command is not implemented in the current version and return a
fixed &quot;NOT IMPLEMENTED&quot; response.
This command issues the CIM operation create instance with the parameters provided.
It requires the [object] parameter defining the class for which the instance is to
be created and also allows for an optional set of parameters that defined properties
to be provided in the following format
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;[propertyName]=value
<P>
If the propertyName parameter is provided with no value, the default is inserted.
Note that the CIM operation is issued even if the property name is illegal since this 
is considered to be a test program.
<P>
The command actually reads the CIM_Class, inserts the properties that have been defined
on the command line using the value type from the class.
<P>
The command will be rejected if the class does not exist in the namespace.
<P>
<B>Example:</B>

<P>
<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>cimcli ci CIM_door name=abc size=zyx<BR>
<P>
Returns the object path of the created instance if the call to the cim server was executed.
Otherwise it returns the exception received.
<P>
<DT><B>ec    EnumerateClasses</B>

<DD>
Issues the enumerateClasses CIM operation which enumerates the class hiearchy starting at the level
defined by &lt;classname&gt;.
<P>
The format is:

<P>
where classname is not required.  If it is omitted, cimcli inserts an empty classname into the CIM operation
which tells the CIM Server to start at the top of the class inheritance tree. 
The possible options that represent the parameters of the enumerateClasses operation are:
<P>
<P>
<B>-niq</B>

Boolean (not_include_Qualifiers) that sets the operation parameter for include_quailifers to false.
<P>
<B>-nlo </B>

Boolean that defines whether properties from superclasses
are included in the response. the -nlo option turns this parameter off
<P>
<B>-cl </B>

Boolean parameter sets the operation parameter classOrigin in the operation request. the CIMServer
is expected to return classOrigin information as part of the response.
<P>
<B>-pl [propertyList]</B>

Optional property list for the operation.
<P>
<B>Examples</B>

<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>TBD<BR>

<TT>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</TT>TBD<BR>
<P>
<DT><B>ni     EnumerateInstanceNames</B>

<DD>
Execute the enumerateInstanceNames CIM Operation. The syntax for this operation is:
<P>

<P>
This operation takes as input options specific
to this command the following:
<P>
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;object&nbsp;-&nbsp;classname&nbsp;for&nbsp;which&nbsp;instancenames&nbsp;are&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;enumerated.
<P>
It displays the instances names that were returned by the CIM server in response to
the enumerateInstances CIM operation with the defined input parameters. if the -s option is set
it returns only the count of names returned.
<P>
In order to provide all of the options allowed for the CIM operation EnumerateInstances it uses the following
options specific to the command:
<P>
-B -nlo
not local only operation parameter to false. Note that this negative form for the
option is used becaused the default for local only parameter is true. Thus, not including this
parameter means that the parameter is not set.
<P>
<B>Example:</B>

<P>

option is used becaused the default for local only parameter is true. Thus, not including this
parameter means that the parameter is not set.
<P>
<B>-niq</B>

Boolean (not_include_Qualifiers) that sets the operation parameter for include_quailifers to false,
Note that this negative form is used because the default for this parameter is true.
<P>

enumerateInstanceNames command to enumerate all of the instances for each class. It returns
the list of all of the instance names found in the namespace.
<P>
The format is:
<P>

<P>
where the options include any of the universal options (ex. namespace, location, etc.)
<P>

<P>
<DT><B>mi    modifyinstance</B>

<DD>
NOTE: This command is not implemented in the current version and return a
fixed &quot;NOT IMPLEMENTED&quot; response.
This is the same format as the createinstance.  The difference is that the instance
must already exist to be modified.
<P>
<DT><B>gi    GetInstance</B>

<DD>
Gets the instance defined by the instance name parameter and displays it
in the format chosen for this operation (xml or mof).
<P>
The syntax for this opration is:

<B>cimcli</B><I>gi</I><B>[objectname]</B><I>[options]</I>

<P>
which causes execution of the CIM getinstance operation.
OR
<P>

<P>
which presents a list of possible instances to the user from which one can be selected
for the getinstance.  In this case, the command actually executes an enumerateInstanceNames
to get the list of instances that is presented to the user.  The getInstance is executed
after the user makes a selection.
<P>
This command requieres the [objectname] parameter.  If the parameter is an instance with
keys defined (a CIMObjectPath), the a getInstance CIM operation is executed and the
return from the CIM Server presented (in either xml or mof depending on the ouput option).
If the input is a class name, a enumerateinstanceNames CIM Operation is executed and if
any instance names are returned the result is presented to the console for the user to
select one of the instances to be deleted.
<P>
If there are no instances, the return from this command is normally an exception as defined
in the DMTF CIM Operations specification..
<P>
<P>

This is an interactive request that returns a list of instances from an
enumerateinstance of CIM_ManagedElement from which the user can select one which cimcli
will return as a complete instance.
<P>
<P>
<DT><B>di    deleteinstance</B>

<DD>
Delete instance executed a single deleteInstance command to the CIM Server.  The syntax is
<P>
<B>cimcli di [objectname] [options]</B>

<P>
This command requires the [objectname] parameter.  If this parameter is a full instance
name with className and key bindings, the deleteInstance CIM Operation is executed
directly.  If it is a class name with no keybindings, the  enumerateInstances command
is executed and the list of returned instances presented to the console for the user
to select one to delete.  cimcli then executes deleteInstance with the selected instance
name and returns the response,
<P>
return - there is an empty response if the instance was successfully deleted or
an exception return if there were any errors.
<P>
cimcli di [object] [options]
<P>
<B>Examples:</B>

<P>
<DT><DD>
cimcli di PG_test

<P>
<DT><B>son</B>

<DD>
Set the CIMServer statistics to enabled by doing a modify instance of the CIM_ObjectManager
instance that defines the server. This depends on the server having implemented statistics and
having also implemented the functionality of enabling and disabling statistics through setting
this property in CIM_ObjectManager.  This should be considered a temporary operation in cimcli until
a more permanent utility is provided with OpenPegasus to manage this type of functionality.  The
corresponding operation soff will attempt to disable statistics on the server.  This works with
OpenPegasus servers starting with version 2.5.1.
<P>
The syntax of the operation is:
<P>

<P>
<DT><B>soff</B>

<DD>
See the operaiton son.  This is the corresponding operation to turn off statistics in the server.
The syntax of the operation is:
<P>

<P>
<DT><B>ns    enumeratenamespaces</B>

<DD>
Request an Enumeration of all the namespaces in the target CIM Server.  This command uses both
the CIM_Namespace class and if that fails, the __Namespace class to determine the list of namespaces.
<P>
RETURN - It returns a list of the namespace names returned by the CIM Server.
<P>
The format of the operation is:

There are a significant number of options to this utility, some if which provide specific information 
for one or more commands and some of which are universal across all of the commands.   In general, the
program does not check for spurious options so that if you input an option that is not used by a particular
operation, it is simply ignored. Note that some of the options require parameters.
<BR>&nbsp;The&nbsp;following&nbsp;is&nbsp;an&nbsp;alphabetic&nbsp;list&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;options.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>-ac assocaton_class_name</B>

<DD>
The Association Class parameter defines an assocClass string for Associator calls (associators and associatornames).
Default(). Example:
-ac CIM_ManagedElement
<DT><B>-ar [association_role_name]</B>

<DD>
Defines an association role for associator operations. Example: -ar dependent. This optional parameter is used only
with the association CIM Operations.
<DT><B>-count [count]</B>

<DD>
Expected count of objects returned if the summary set. Tests this count and display difference.
Terminates the cimcli call nonzero if test fails  . Default(). This can be used in testing to confirm that a predefined
number of objects is returned. Example: -count 100 will expect 100 objects or names to be returned
<DT><B>-delay [time in seconds]</B>

<DD>
Delay between connection and request . Default(0). example -delay 3 delays 3 seconds between the call and the
transmisson of the actual CIM operation.  This is used only in some testing environments.
<DT><B>-di</B>

<DD>
Specifies the boolean parameter deepInheritance parameter for selected commands. Setting this options 
causes the deepinheritance=tru to be transmitted for the operation.
Note that this means different things to different commands and is used only with the enumerate commands.
<DT><B>-ic</B>

<DD>
Boolean to set include class origin operation parameter to true.
<DT><B>-iq</B>

<DD>
(DEPRECATED}Specifies the includeQualifiers operation input paramter for selected commands.Since the server default 
for this parameter is normally true, This option
is deprecated in favor of the -niq parameters  
<DT><B>-l [location]</B>

<DD>
Define CIMServer host address for the operation.  This includes either name or IP address and optional
port number(HostName:port).  The default is localhost:5988.  If name is used without port, port 5988 is assumed.
Examples include -l fred, -l fred:9999, -l 10.1.134.66 -l 10.1.134.123:5977
<P>
<DT><B>-lo</B>

<DD>
Specifies the localOnly operation parameter for selected commands if the option is set.
See the commands for more information. This option is Deprecated in favor of the -nlo because the
default for local only is on so that generally the -lo is simply the default.  We recommend using
-nlo to turn off local only.
<P>
<DT><B>-n [Namespace]</B>

<DD>
Defines the namespace for the operation.host name. The default is root/cimv2. exmple -n root/PG_Interop sets
the root/PG_Interop namespace as the namespace for the current operation. 
<P>
<DT><B>-p [password]</B>

<DD>
Allows input of a password for server authentication of the command. ( ex. -p 12345678). The default is
that the command is submitted with no password.
<P>
<DT><B>-u [User]</B>

<DD>
Defines nser ame for CIM Server authentication. Default is no user name and no authentication.
( ex -u john) Default is no user name and no authentication.
<P>
<DT><B>-lo </B>

<DD>
DEPRECATED. This was used to set LocalOnly. However, default should be true and we cannot use True as default. 
See -nlo. Default(true).
<P>
<DT><B>-nlo</B>

<DD>
When set, sets LocalOnly = false on the CIM operation. Default(false).
<P>
<DT><B>-niq</B>

<DD>
Sets includeQualifiers = false on operations. Default(false).
<P>
<DT><B>-pl [propertyList]</B>

<DD>
Defines a propertyName List which is an optional parmeter for some CIM Operations. Format is p1,p2,p3 (without spaces).
Default is that the property list is set to NULL indicating normally that the operation should return all properties.
The property list typically has 3 possibilities 1) empty which means return no properties, 2) list of properties to
be returned, 3) NULL which means return all properties.  Since the default is NULL, not applying the option means that
all properties are being requested.  To set this parameter to empty use the form -pl &quot;&quot;. 
<P>
<P>
<DT><B>-r [role]</B>

<DD>
Defines a role string for reference role parameter. Default()
<P>
<DT><B>-rc [resultClass]</B>

<DD>
Defines a resultClass string for References and Associatiors. Default()
<P>
<DT><B>-rr [resultRole]</B>

<DD>
Defines a role string for associators operation resultRole parameter. . Default()
<P>
<DT><B>-ip [inputParameterList]</B>

<DD>
Defines an invokeMethod input parameter list. Format is p1=v1,p2=v2,..,pn=vn (without spaces) . Default()
<P>
<DT><B>-f [filter]</B>

<DD>
Defines a filter to use for query. One String input . Default()
<P>
<DT><B>-o [ xml | mof ]</B>

<DD>
Output in xml, mof, txt. Default(mof) if the -o options is not included.
<P>
<DT><B>-x</B>

<DD>
Output objects in xml instead of mof format. Default(false)
<P>
<DT>/B --v<DD>
Displays cimcli and Pegasus software Version.
<P>
<DT><B>-v</B>

<DD>
Verbose Display. Includes Detailed Param Input display . Default(false). Outputs extra information about the
parameters actually used in the request and the return from the operation.  This is primarily a debugging tool.
<P>
<DT><B>--sum</B>

<DD>
Displays only summary counts for enumerations, associators, etc.This option is used to with the
repeat option to repeat an operation without getting the full return display.  It reduces the display to summary
information.  It is often used with the time option --t to generate time for execution information on many repetitions
of a command.
<P>
<DT><B>-h</B>

<DD>
Prints help usage message.
<P>
<DT><B>--help</B>

<DD>
Prints full help message with commands, options, examples.
<P>
<DT><B>-ho</B>

<DD>
Prints list of cimcli options.
<P>
<DT><B>-hc</B>

<DD>
Prints cimcli Operation command list.  This list includes the CIM Operatons defined by
the CIM Operations specification and other operations that were felt to be useful in
testing CIM environments.
<P>
<DT><B>--timeout [seconds]</B>

<DD>
Set the connection timeout in seconds. If not set, the timeout
is the default Pegasus client timeout which for Pegasus is normally to about 30 seconds. This option executes
the client call to set timeout.
<P>
<DT><B>-d</B>

<DD>
More detailed debug messages from cimcli. This can be useful in the case where the user is debugging
CIM funtionality.
<P>
<DT><B>-trace [trace_level]</B>

<DD>
Set Pegasus Common Components Trace. Sets the Trace level. 0 isoff. Default(0). The trace level can be
set to 0 - 4.
<P>
<DT><B>--r [repeat_count]</B>

<DD>
Number of times to repeat the function. Zero means one time. The option ca be used to
repeate an operation within a single call to cimcli.  It simply repeats the operation defined the
number of times defined by the repeate_count within the same connection.  Thus, it establishes
the connection executes the operation repeat_count times and then terminates.  It can be used with
the --time option to measure execution times for many repetitions of an operation.
<P>
<DT><B>--t</B>

<DD>
Measure time for the operation and present results. When set the response
time for the operation is presented with the command output. If the --r (repeat) option is
set, minimum, maximum, and average times are presented.  Note that the time for the operation itself
is presented in addition to the overall time for connect, operation, and disconnect.  If statistics
are being gathered by the server, setting this option also presents the server time, and the
client round trip time which are calculated by the server and client infrastructure. 
<P>
<DT><B>-s</B>

<DD>
Boolean option thatpecifies that the Client should attempt to connnect over the secure connection using SSL. This option
causes cimcli to modify the client connect call to set the SSLContext option to the certificate defined 
with the --cert and --key options.  If this option is set but neither the --cert or --key options are included,
the SSLContext for the connect call is submitted with the Cert and key marked NULL.
<P>
<DT><B>--cert</B>

<DD>
Defines a certificate to be used with the client connect if the -s option is set. This is optional and used
only  with the -s and --key options.
<P>
<DT><B>--key</B>

<DD>
Defines a Client private key. This is optional and only has an effect on connections made over HTTPS using -s

<H2>BUGS</H2>

Currently at least some platforms and shells have problems with the double-quote which
is used extensively in object names within CIM. To get around this, the
character '@' has been mapped to the double-quote so that inputting
a command line with this character in place of quotes is acceptable.
Thus, for example, 
<P>
cimcli rn TST_Person.name=@MIKE@ ...
<P>
is equivalent to
<P>
cimcli rn TST_Person.name-&quot;MIKE&quot; ...
<P>
In this version there is no way to turn this character mapping off which
means that the @ character is lost.
